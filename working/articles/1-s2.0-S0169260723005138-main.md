Aim: The purpose of this study was to develop a simple viscoelastic model to characterize the mechanical
properties of chests during manual chest compressions in pre-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
Methods: Force and acceleration signals were extracted from CPR monitors used during pre-hospital resuscitation
attempts on adult patients. Individual chest compressions were identiﬁed and segmented from the chest
displacement computed using the force and acceleration. Each compression-recoil cycle was characterized by
its elastic coeﬃcient 𝑘(a measure of stiﬀness) and its compression and recoil damping coeﬃcients, 𝑑𝑐and 𝑑𝑟,
respectively (measures of viscosity). We compared the estimated and the calculated chest displacement to assess
the goodness of ﬁt of the model. We characterized the chest of patients at the beginning of CPR in relation to sex
and age, and their variation as CPR progressed.
Results: A total of 1,156,608 chest compressions from 615 patients were analysed. Mean (95% CI) coeﬃcient
of determination R2 for the viscoelastic model was 97.9% (97.8–98.1). At the beginning of CPR, 𝑘was 104.9
N⋅cm-1 (102.0–107.8), 𝑑𝑐was 2.868 N⋅s⋅cm-1 (2.751–2.984) and 𝑑𝑟was 4.889 N⋅s⋅cm-1 (4.648–5.129). Damping
during recoil was signiﬁcantly higher than during compression. Stiﬀness was lower in women than in men. There
were no diﬀerences in damping coeﬃcients with sex but a higher 𝑑𝑟with increasing age. All model coeﬃcients
decreased with compression count, with an overall decrease after 3,000 chest compressions of 34.6%, 48.8% and
37.2%, respectively.
Conclusion: The model accurately described adult chest mechanical properties during CPR, highlighting
diﬀerences between compression and recoil, sex and age, and a progressive reduction in chest stiﬀness and
viscosity along resuscitation. Our ﬁndings may merit further investigation into whether patient-tailored and
time-sensitive chest compression technique may be appropriate.
1. Introduction
Delivering high quality chest compressions is a key component of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) [1,2]. Adequate compression of
the chest intends to force blood ﬂow out of the heart to the lungs
and body while allowing chest recoil enables blood to return, in or-

der to maintain perfusion of a patient in cardiorespiratory arrest [3,4].
For more than a decade, studies have shown that rescuers’ adherence
to chest compression quality recommendations is good with the use
of feedback devices [5–7]. However, the tendency to perform shallow clinical chest compressions even with automated feedback may
be explained by factors other than the physical incapacity of the reshttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107847

cuer [7]. Speciﬁcally, when chest compressions are applied manually,
chest movement relies on patient’s chest mechanical properties in response to the force applied by rescuers during compression and release.
Viscoelastic models have been proposed to explain the non-linear relationship between applied force and chest displacement during chest
compressions [8], using animal data [9], data from human cadavers [10,11], or from patients in cardiorespiratory arrest [11,12]. Viscoelastic models are generally widely accepted, as they explain the
elastic behaviour of the rib cage and the internal organs, as well as the
damped behaviour of ﬂuids and soft tissues within the thorax. Proposed
models have been tested primarily in laboratory settings with compressions administered mechanically, with a few number of patients,
or during short CPR intervals.
Previous studies have revealed that applying manual compressions
for a prolonged period of time changes chest properties. [13,14]. Other
studies have associated changes in chest wall mechanics with sternal and rib fractures during mechanical chest compressions, and have
reported an impact on outcomes [15]. Understanding the interaction
between applied force, achieved depth and patient haemodynamic response along the course of resuscitation attempts may contribute to
improving treatment and outcomes.
In this context, the aim of this observational study was to apply a
simple and innovative viscoelastic model to describe the chest mechanical properties observed during manual chest compressions in out-ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) adult cases. The model accommodates
diﬀerences in the viscosity of the chest between compression and recoil phases. We assessed the accuracy of the model in the estimation
of instantaneous chest displacement from exerted force. We characterized chest model parameters at the beginning of the intervention and
evaluated the model behaviour over the duration of resuscitation. The
simplicity of the model allowed estimation of the dynamic behaviour
of the chest along the course of CPR for diﬀerent populations. The
observed diﬀerences could support the appropriateness of a patientadapted and time-sensitive chest compression technique, moving away
from the current standardized approach during resuscitation.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Data collection
Force
and
acceleration
signals
were
extracted
from
monitor-deﬁbrillators (Heartstart MRx, Phillips Healthcare, USA)
equipped with chest compression monitors (Q-CPR®) used during adult
prehospital cardiac arrest episodes attended by Tualatin Valley Fire &
Rescue (TVF&R), a single ﬁrst response advanced life support (ALS)
emergency medical service (EMS) agency (Tigard, Oregon, USA), from
2013 through 2017. The database is a part of the Portland Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Epidemiological Cardiac Arrest Registry,
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB00001736) of the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Patient personal information
is not included in the records. TVF&R crews provided continuous chest
compressions with interposed ventilations every 10th compression regardless of airway type. Responders beneﬁted from real-time feedback
on chest compression quality including rate, depth and completeness of
release. For this study, we selected cases of adult patients who received
at least 200 chest compressions.
2.2. Theory: description of the chest model
Our model relies on the classical assumption that the applied force
during chest compressions can be decomposed into the sum of an elastic force and a damping force, that is, the chest is modelled with a
spring and a damper in parallel disposition [8,11]. Accordingly, the
instantaneous applied force 𝐹(𝑡) is the sum of the elastic force 𝐹𝑒(𝑡), being proportional to the chest displacement 𝑥(𝑡), and the damping force
𝐹𝑑(𝑡), being proportional to the chest velocity 𝑣(𝑡):
𝐹(𝑡) = 𝐹𝑒(𝑡) + 𝐹𝑑(𝑡) = 𝑘⋅𝑥(𝑡) + 𝑑⋅𝑣(𝑡)
(1)
where 𝑘is the elastic coeﬃcient, 𝑥(𝑡) the chest displacement, 𝑑is the
damping coeﬃcient and 𝑣(𝑡) the chest velocity. The elastic coeﬃcient
allows to characterize the stiﬀness of the chest, or its inverse, the elasticity. We can refer to either term interchangeably, with the understanding
that the behaviour of one reﬂects the inverse behaviour of the other.
In order to accommodate the anticipated diﬀerences in viscosity between chest compression and recoil phases we introduced separated
damping coeﬃcients in our model:
𝐹𝑐(𝑡) = 𝑘⋅𝑥𝑐(𝑡) + 𝑑𝑐⋅𝑣𝑐(𝑡)
(2)
𝐹𝑟(𝑡) = 𝑘⋅𝑥𝑟(𝑡) −𝑑𝑟⋅𝑣𝑟(𝑡)
(3)
where 𝐹𝑐(𝑡) and 𝐹𝑟(𝑡) are the instantaneous exerted forces during compression and release, achieving displacements 𝑥𝑐(𝑡) and 𝑥𝑟(𝑡), respectively. Coeﬃcients 𝑑𝑐and 𝑑𝑟are the compression and recoil damping
coeﬃcients, respectively. The negative sign in Equation (3) indicates
the opposite direction of the chest movement during recoil. With this
model, we characterized each chest compression by its elastic coeﬃcient 𝑘(a measure of stiﬀness), and its compression and recoil damping
coeﬃcients (measures of viscosity).
2.3. Calculation: data annotation and estimation of the model parameters
Chest displacement and velocity signals were calculated from acceleration [16]. Individual chest compressions were automatically detected using force and depth signals [13]. Fig. 1 shows an overview of
a selected interval of our database (panel A) along with the annotation
detail of each compression (B). Each compression was segmented into
compression and recoil phases using the beginning and end points and
the instant of maximum downward chest displacement 𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥(Fig. 1).
Locations and values of the maximum compression velocity (𝐶𝑉), maximum recoil velocity (𝑅𝑉), and maximum compression force (𝐹𝑚𝑎𝑥)
within each compression were annotated.
The ratio 𝐹𝑚𝑎𝑥/𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥allowed for computing the elastic coeﬃcient 𝑘.
This relationship can be referred to as stiﬀness, in line with the terminology used by other authors [13,17]. Henceforth, the behaviour
of the coeﬃcient 𝑘directly describes the behaviour of the stiﬀness of
the chest. For simpliﬁcation, we ignored the lag between the instant of
maximum force and the instant when the chest reaches the maximum
depth [13]. For computing the compression damping coeﬃcient 𝑑𝑐we
used 𝐶𝑉and the concurrent force and displacement employing Equation (2). Similarly, for computing the recoil damping coeﬃcient 𝑑𝑟we
used 𝑅𝑉and the concurrent force and displacement employing Equation (3).
2.4. Validation of the model
To assess the accuracy of the model, we estimated the instantaneous
chest displacement from the model parameters calculated for each single compression and compared it with the chest displacement computed
from the chest acceleration. For this purpose, the instantaneous chest
displacement was estimated by solving this variable in Equation (2)
and Equation (3):
̃𝑥𝑐(𝑡) = 𝐹𝑐(𝑡) −𝑑𝑐⋅𝑣(𝑡)
𝑘
(4)
̃𝑥𝑟(𝑡) = 𝐹𝑟(𝑡) + 𝑑𝑟⋅𝑣(𝑡)
𝑘
(5)
where ̃𝑥𝑐(𝑡) and ̃𝑥𝑟(𝑡) are the estimated chest displacement during compression and recoil, respectively.
For comparison purposes, we also estimated the chest displacement
using a simpliﬁed purely elastic model as:
̃𝑥(𝑡) = 𝐹(𝑡)
𝑘

2.5. Statistical analysis
We evaluated the goodness of ﬁt of the chest model through the coeﬃcient of determination R2 of the diﬀerence between the measured
and the estimated chest displacement signals per individual chest compression using the expression:
R2 = 1 −
Σ𝑁
𝑖=1[𝑥(𝑡𝑖) −̃𝑥(𝑡𝑖)]2
Σ𝑁
𝑖=1[𝑥(𝑡𝑖) −̄𝑥]2
(7)
where 𝑁is the number of samples for each individual chest compression; 𝑡𝑖is the time instant corresponding to the sample 𝑖; 𝑥(𝑡𝑖) is
the measured (observed) displacement at 𝑡𝑖; ̃𝑥(𝑡𝑖) is the displacement
estimated by the model at 𝑡𝑖and ̄𝑥is the mean value of the measured
displacement along each individual chest compression.
To characterize patients chests at the beginning of CPR, the model
parameters were estimated from the ﬁrst 100 chest compressions using
generalized linear mixed eﬀects (GLME) with patient as random eﬀect,
and sex, age, and receipt of bystander CPR as ﬁxed eﬀects when assessing for diﬀerences. Age was used as a continuous variable and as a
categorical variable: <50, 50–80, and >80 years old. Results were reported using the estimated mean and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI), and
the 𝑝values from the GLME analysis. We considered non-overlapping
95% CI intervals as statistically signiﬁcant. The Kruskal-Wallis test was
used to study diﬀerences between age groups, for which 𝑝values below

0.017 were considered signiﬁcant (after Bonferroni correction for three
comparisons).
Values were grouped every 100 chest compressions and normalised
to the median of the case’s ﬁrst 100 compressions for analysing
the model evolution with compression count. [14] Signiﬁcance of
trends with compression count were assessed with Jonckheere-Terpstra
tests [18]. We considered 𝑝𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑(from tests for trend) values below 0.05
to be statistically signiﬁcant. Signal processing and statistical analyses
were performed with custom Matlab® (Natick, MA, USA) programs, using version R2021a. The results of all tests performed are reported.
3. Results
TVF&R responded to 703 cases between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 in which deﬁbrillator/monitor recordings were acquired.
Of them, 615 were from adult patients that received at least 200 chest
compressions (Fig. 2).
A total of 1,156,608 chest compressions were annotated from 615
adult OHCA patients, with a median (IQR) of 1,720 (1,036–2,609)
compressions per patient, ranging from 200 to 5,849. Patient characteristics are reported in Table 1. Median age was 66 (53–77) years and
34% of the patients were female. Restoration of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC) at any time occurred in 40% of the patients and bystander CPR
was provided in 68% of the patients. Median (IQR) compression depth
was 5.1 cm (4.5–5.6), and median compression rate was 118 min−1
(114–122).
Overall, mean R2 was 97.9 (95% CI 97.8–98.1) signiﬁcantly higher
than the R2 obtained with the pure elastic model (85.8, 95% CI
85.3–86.5), 𝑝 < 0.001.
3.1. Characterization of patient’s chest at the beginning of chest
compressions
Table 2 shows the values of the model parameters at the beginning of chest compressions (ﬁrst 100 chest compressions). Overall
mean elastic coeﬃcient 𝑘was 104.9 N⋅cm-1 (95% CI 102.0–107.8).
Mean compression damping coeﬃcient 𝑑𝑐was 2.868 N⋅s⋅cm-1 (95% CI
2.751–2.984). Mean recoil damping coeﬃcient 𝑑𝑟was 4.889 N⋅s⋅cm-1
(95% CI 4.648–5.129), much higher than the compression damping coeﬃcient (𝑝 < 0.001).

and for recoil were found between the sexes (𝑝 = 0.34, 𝑝 = 0.36, respectively. Age did not inﬂuence 𝑘(𝑝 = 0.57) or 𝑑𝑐(𝑝 = 0.51), although 𝑑𝑟
increased with age (𝑝 < 0.001), and was clearly diﬀerent among the
three age groups studied (𝑝 < 0.001 for the three two-by-two combinations of the age groups studied after Kruskal-Wallis test). Regarding
patients receiving bystander CPR or not, we did not observe statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in any of the three model parameters at the beginning of EMS intervention (𝑝 = 0.62, 𝑝 = 0.08 and 𝑝 = 0.95 for 𝑘, 𝑑𝑐,
and 𝑑𝑟, respectively).
3.2. Evolution of the model parameters with compression count
First, we assessed the goodness of ﬁt of the model as CPR progressed.
The correlation coeﬃcient R2 kept stable with compression count at an
average of 98.9% with little variation as CPR progressed (𝑝𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑= 0.034,
Fig. 3). In contrast, R2 for the purely elastic model increased from an
initial 86.3% to 91.5% after 3,000 chest compressions (𝑝𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑< 0.001).
This increase was notably monotonic after approximately 1,000 chest
compressions.

more accurate viscoelastic model, resemblance of the chest to a pure spring
increased after the ﬁrst 1,000 compressions.

4. Discussion
The importance of adequate chest compressions has been highlighted by resuscitation guidelines over the years. However, the wellestablished and universal chest compressions goals for depth, rate and
recoil involve adapting manual chest compressions to wide variations
of human chest characteristics among patients and during the course
of resuscitation eﬀorts. The motivation of our study was to propose a
simple model to characterize the mechanical properties of adult human
chest and to study how these properties vary during the course of resuscitation eﬀorts and to facilitate comparative population analysis.
There are several studies proposing mathematical models for human chest characterization in order to better understand its response to
exerted force during CPR. From studies using manikins or test bench,
animal or human data, viscoelastic models which support that human
chest behaves as a spring in parallel with a damper are the most widely
accepted. These studies have had an impact on the design of more realistic training manikins but their mathematical complexity has made it
diﬃcult to apply them in the context of prolonged CPR.
The non-linear relationship between force and chest displacement
during chest compressions shows a characteristic hysteresis [8,12,17,
19], which supports the need for diﬀerentiating compression and recoil
phases. Our model was eﬀective by introducing separated damping coeﬃcients, and ﬁtted well to the characteristics of individual patients,
irrespective of sex, age and of chest changes as compressions were prolonged (R2 of 97.9, 95% CI 97.8–98.1). As expected, the viscoelastic
model outperformed the pure elastic model in all criteria evaluated.
Damping was notably higher during recoil than during compression.
During compression the chest follows the responder’s action. During decompression, two phases can be distinguished [14]: one extending from
the exerted peak force to the instant when the responder releases the
force almost completely and the following phase, when the chest recoils
unopposed. This particular feature during decompression may explain
the large diﬀerence between the values of compression and recoil damping coeﬃcients.
We found diﬀerences in the model parameters among patients at the
beginning of EMS chest compressions, indicating that physiological differences may also deserve attention in CPR science. Our results suggest
that chests are more elastic (less stiﬀ) in women than in men, tend to be
stiﬀer with age and notably more viscous during recoil in older patients.
Interestingly, all the model parameters decreased as CPR progressed.
Decreasing of the elastic coeﬃcient (by 35%) implies that the chest becomes less stiﬀ with compression count, in line with previous research
on this topic [13,17]. Damping coeﬃcients decreased with compressions, especially during the compression phase (49%), validating the
decrease in chest viscosity and the progressive resemblance of the chest
to a spring in prolonged CPR. We conﬁrmed this eﬀect since the goodness of ﬁt of the viscoelastic model was not aﬀected by prolonged CPR,
but the coeﬃcient of determination for the pure elastic model increased
with compressions, that is, the elastic component of the chest becomes
more relevant in extended CPR. Decreasing of chest stiﬀness and viscosity with compression count was higher in women than in men, and with
increasing age, particularly noticeable in oldest patients (see details in
Table 3). Therefore, in the course of resuscitation, diﬀerences between
patients are compounded by changes caused by prolonged exposure to
the compression-decompression nature of CPR.
Responders from the ALS EMS agency providing the cases for this
study beneﬁted from real-time feedback on chest compression rate,
depth and complete release. Despite diﬀerences between patients and
changes of chest properties during the resuscitation eﬀort, responders
were able to adapt the exerted force to maintain consistency in compression depth and rate [13,14]. In fact, little improvement in chest
compression depth was observed but a decrease in the maximal exerted
force was observed as CPR was prolonged. This is compatible with the
idea reﬂected in our model, that the reduction in stiﬀness and viscosity
makes it easier to achieve the desired depth and that responders reduce
their force consequently.
Several studies have put the spotlight on the fact that the signiﬁcant
decrease in chest stiﬀness with time could be due to rib or sternal fractures which commonly occur during CPR [15,17]. Recently, it has been
suggested that high force variations during mechanical CPR are associated with ribcage injuries and worse outcomes [15]. We conﬁrmed
the signiﬁcant decrease in chest stiﬀness as manual CPR progressed,
but since rescuers could adapt their manoeuvre, we hypothesize that
the incidence of rib cage injuries could be lower with manual CPR.
In any case, evidences relating changes in chest properties and CPRrelated injuries and lower outcomes may support further investigation
into whether patient-tailored and time-sensitive CPR is necessary.
An issue that may deserve further investigation is that we found
no diﬀerences at the beginning of EMS CPR between patients who did
or did not receive bystander CPR beforehand. This was unexpected, as
we anticipated that stiﬀness would have decreased in response to the
bystander CPR. This ﬁnding may indicate that bystander CPR was not
suﬃcient to consider this group of patients outside the general group
chest characteristics. This might reﬂect poor quality of bystander chest
compressions in terms of compression depth or chest recoil. Of note we
did observe more changes with EMS CPR in patients that had received
bystander CPR over time suggesting that this does indeed impact chest
properties over time.
4.1. Limitations
Cases included in the study came from a single ALS EMS agency.
Using our model with data from bystander CPR using AEDs could extend the results and reinforce the conclusions, although it would be
necessary to equip current AEDs with the ability to record force and
acceleration signals during CPR. In addition, rescuers beneﬁted from
real-time feedback on the quality of chest compressions and could administer an “adaptive” CPR to adhere to the recommendations. It might
be interesting to apply our model during prolonged CPR in the absence
of real-time feedback. Another limitation is that we did not have information to control change of rescuers and to assess consistency from
the beginning to the end of individual chest compression series. Finally,
we had no information about possible deformities or injuries during the

course of CPR, or about patient chest size and body mass index. Having this information would provide valuable information to support or
discourage the idea of adapting the compression manoeuvre to each
patient.
5. Conclusions
Adult human chests can be accurately characterized with a simple
viscoelastic model accounting for diﬀerences in compression and recoil
phases. Using the model parameters we have been able to characterize diﬀerences in chest properties at the beginning of EMS-CPR. As a
general rule, damping (viscosity) was higher during recoil than during
compression. Women’s chests were less stiﬀ than men’s, and damping
during recoil increased with age. No diﬀerences were observed between
patients who did or did not receive bystander CPR. Interestingly, chest
stiﬀness and viscosity decreased as CPR progressed, more in women
than in men, more as age increased and more in patients having received bystander CPR. Our ﬁndings support further investigation into
whether patient-tailored and time-sensitive CPR is of value.
