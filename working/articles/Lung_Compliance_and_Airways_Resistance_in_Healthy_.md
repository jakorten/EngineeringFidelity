Abstract
Objectives: This study aimed to determine the values and their evolution of Crs and Rrs during the first 3 weeks
of life.
Subjects and methods: We carried out a longitudinal study of static lung compliance (Crs) and airways
resistance (Rrs) in apparent healthy preterm and term neonates (n=32), and further in a group of preterm babies
with a respiratory distress syndrome (n=10). Lung function testing was performed at day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21. Additive
sedation, when necessary, was given orally (chloral hydrate 50 mg/kg). The instrumentation was the 2605 Infant
Hugger prototype.
Results:
The healthy or control population: The female neonates had significantly higher values of Crs, and this was
present already at birth and remained so after birth. There was a significant increase (20%) of static lung compliance
after birth and that increase remained in a plateau state. The changes in Rrs showed no statistically differences after
birth within both groups, but Rrs after birth was significantly lower when more mature babies were compared with
more premature neonates. It was also interesting to note that Rrs increased after birth in more premature babies
without reaching a statistical significance however.
The neonates with RDS: In comparison to the control population, the static lung compliance had an important
reduction of Crs : nearly 4 fold decrease in the begin of disease, and this remained a 2 fold decrease till 14 days. The
sick neonates, again in comparison to the control group, had an important increase of Rrs: about 3 fold increase in the
begin of disease, and 50 % increase at 14 days.
Conclusion: The Crs and Rrs observed in healthy neonates should be inserted in software of instruments for
respiratory support (also nasal CPAP) in order to improve the strategy and decision during the acute phase.

Introduction
Sick newborn babies have frequently respiratory difficulties and
hence they may require a type of ventilator support [1-6]. The fetal
lung maturation by steroids given in the pregnancies carrying the
risk of prematurity, together with a better control of the perinatal
infection and a better and more appropriate nutrition are the major
explaining factors for the decrease in the frequency and severity of
respiratory distress or RDS in newborn babies [2]. The most frequent
mode of neonatal respiratory support at the present time is the nasal
continuous positive airway pressure or nCPAP. The high frequency
oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), the conventional ventilation and the
administration of surfactant tube are still used. Actually, the neonates
born lately premature (> 34 weeks gestational age), and this is probably
due to a combination of perinatal infection and a less well fetal
preparation, may present a severe respiratory malfunction in the acute
phase. The chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
has also declined in its frequency and severity [3,6,7].
Several studies concerning lung function in preterm and term
infants have already been reported concerning the neonatal period and
the follow up lifetime [8-29]. We are aware that the numeric findings
of Crs and Rrs values in this study are not new. To our knowledge, this
type of study where these parameters are precisely analyzed are scarce
in the literature. This work is a part of several prospective research
projects started in 1990 and still continuing [11-13,17-19,30-32]. The
target of these studies are: 1. To define the strategy and the effects
of HFOV or high frequency ventilatory oscillation; 2. To define the
parameters of cerebral blood flow auto regulation; 2. To analyze the
effects of drugs, general anesthesia and surfactant therapy on cerebral
circulation. In the present study, the project was to follow the values
and their changes of lung compliance (CRs) and airways resistance
(Rrs) during the first weeks of life in apparently normal premature
newborns in order to apply these parameters of lung function during
the acute phase of babies with RDS supported by n CPAP.
Subjects and Methods
Subjects
This study comprised 32 neonates as the control group (Table
1). The apparent healthy state of these babies in the neonatal period
has been confirmed in the long term follow-up (final age of 9 years)
by a consequent normal growth, a normal development, an absence

of airways hyper reactivity. The premature neonates were those born
before 37 weeks. They did not present any respiratory difficulties, were
not infected, had none malformation and had a normal fetal growth.
This control group was further divided in two subgroups owing to the
attended surfactant synthesis and the previously mentioned fragility of
late prematurity: those born before 34 weeks, and those born after 33
weeks 6 days. Even if the samples of both populations (control and sick
neonates) may look small, they were sufficient to meet the Student’s
test statistical criteria, together with the number of measures done
sufficient [33,34] (Tables 1 and 2).
Methods
Lung function testing was performed at day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21. The
sedation, when necessary, was given orally (chloral hydrate 50 mg/
kg). The instrumentation was the 2605 Infant Hugger prototype, a
pneumotach instrument with a complete flow measurement system
including pressure transducers and electronics for Flow Sensor input,
an auxiliary pressure input, and analog outputs. It can calculate flow
rates and provide correction for gas density, viscosity, temperature,
barometric pressure, and airway pressure. It automatically detects start
and end of breath and calculates the following ventilatory parameters:
tidal breathing, I and E volumes, respiratory rate, I and E time, static
and dynamic compliance, resistance, terminal compliance, PEP,
PIP, MAP, FRC. It can be used through a facial mask or through the
endotracheal tube. On primary intention, owing to their importance
in lung mechanics, we recorded the lung static compliance (Crs)
expressed in ml/cm H2O/sec, and the static airways resistance (Rrs)
expressed in cm H20/ml/sec
Results
Analysis of the static lung compliance in the control
population
When we compared the results concerning Crs changes after birth
between males and females in the control group, we see that female
neonates had significantly higher values of Crs. And this was present
already at birth and remained so after birth (Tables 3, 4 and 5).
When all the babies were gathered, whatever the gestational age or
sex at birth, we obtained the following values (mean ± SD):
-	At day 1: 1.37 ± 0.37 ml/cm H2O/sec
-	At day 3: 1.60 ± 0.40
-	At day 7: 1.67 ± 0.41
-	At day 14: 1.62 ± 0.44
-	At day 21: 156 ± 0.42
There was a significant increase of Crs of observed after birth and it
remained relatively stable afterwards. It is interesting to note, however,
that the greatest increase was always observed at day 7. If we take into
consideration the gestational age and the sex at birth, other significant
differences appeared: 1. a statistically significant increase of Crs after
the day 1 within both subgroups and a significant difference in the
absolute increase of Crs between both subgroups.
In both sexes, there was a significant increase (20 %) of static lung
compliance after birth, and that increase remained stable in a plateau.
The greatest increase was always observed at day 7.
Analysis of the static airways resistance in the control
population

The global increase of Rrs over the days was 25 %. This increase
in Rrs, even if interesting to be observed after birth, was however not
statistically significant.
When the gestational age at birth was considered, significant
differences appeared.
The changes in Rrs showed no statistically differences after birth
within both groups, but Rrs after birth was significantly lower when
more mature babies were compared with more premature neonates.
It was also interesting to note that the progressive increase in Rrs after
birth observed in more premature babies could not reach a statistical
significance. The end of the first postnatal week of life evidenced the
smallest Rrs.
Analysis of the static lung compliance and airways resistance
in the sick population
Lung compliance: The sick neonates, in comparison to the control
population, had an important reduction of Crs: nearly 4 fold decrease
in the begin of disease, and this remained a 2 fold decrease till 14 days
(Table 8).
Airways resistance: The sick neonates, again in comparison to the
control group, had an important increase of Rrs: about 3 fold increase
in the begin of disease, and 50 % increase at 14 days.
In our population of sick neonates, both lung tissue for gas
exchange (alveolar tree) and airways conductance were concerned on
an important level. The observed values of Crs and Rrs reflect the fact
that the the alveolar tree was more affected than the conductive part,
and mainly in the acute phase of disease. On a level of lung mechanics’
terms, this is corresponding to state associating an obstructing and a
restricting state.
Discussion
We consider the present work as an opportunity for adding a
consideration on physiology of lung mechanics in early life among other
studies. We may say that the observed changes at birth and during the
postnatal days reflect the adaptation of lung function (see introduction).
The observed increase in Crs is probably due to a combination of
several factors: the progressive disappearance of the interstitial fluids,
the intervention of endogenous surfactant effect on alveolar surface,
and the adaptation of airways resistance on the outflow of air. These
combined events could explain the observed highest (for Crs) and
lowest (for Rrs) values at the end of the first week of life. Again, these
same events, not really found in the population of sick neonates with
RDS, could explain the fact that the physiological adaptation could not
be encountered in these infants. With the improvement in survival rate
of very low birth weight infants (birth weight less than 1500 g), research
efforts have been devoted to developing new ventilation strategies to
reduce lung damage from positive pressure ventilation, to maintain
an appropriate circulation and to preserve the brain. The principal
benefits of ventilation are improved gas exchange, decrease work
of breathing, and ventilation for patients with apnea or respiratory
depression. The lung mechanics in neonates has been well studied
over the years. The mode of neonatal ventilator support has changed
over the years even if more prematurely newborn babies are taken in
charge in neonatal intensive care units (see above). The antenatal lung
maturation by steroids and the postnatal use of surfactant, together
with other measures of treatments explain this evolution. Nasal
CPAP is now the most frequent mode of ventilator support. The new
ventilators deserve more and more a screen showing continuously
the lung functions loops. This increases the possibility to follow the
optimality of ventilation and also to provide parameters (flow-volume
loop, pressure-volume loop, Crs and Rrs) which are important for the
decision during sickness, and also for the prognosis and outcome. The
possibility to setup alarms for these parameters within the ventilator,
as it is already feasible for other paramters outside the ventilator (heart
and respiratory rates, saturation, blood pressure) would be beneficial
when mechanical ventilation is needed. As nCPAP is actually the most
frequent mode of ventilator support in neonates, an instrumentation
of lung functions tests using here the jacket mode for plethysmography
could bring to the clinician interesting points. This allows further to
follow the effects of surfactant therapy, fluid therapy, ductus arteriosus
shunting therapy not only on the lung function, but also on the
hemodynamics of the brain, and the use of nitrogen instead of helium
allows the analysis of lung diffusion, and that would further provide
a way to follow the lung state in these babies, not solely in the acute
phase but also in the recovering of a BPD phase. In our opinion, an
instrument like Exhalyzer D for lung function assessment in all aspects
seems suitable for this kind of study. All these points represent several
reasons for a neonatologist but also for nurses working in neonatal
intensive care units to have a good knowledge of the significance of the
different loops visible on the screen of ventilator support, in order to
better assess the state of lung function in the sick neonate.
