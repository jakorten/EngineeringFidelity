## Relevance to Paper

**Claims Supported:** V3 (Chest wall compliance ratio)

**Key Evidence:**
- "the chest wall is ~3 times more compliant than the lungs in term neonates" (Section 5.2, p.6)
- "CCW is ~5 times greater than CL in preterm infants but is only ~3 times greater in term infants" (Section 6.2, p.8)

## Key Data Extracted

### Chest Wall Compliance by Gestational Age (Section 6.2)

| Population | CCW (mL/cmH2O/kg) | Source |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Preterm (<28 wks) | ~7.2 | Gerhardt & Bancalari 1980 |
| Term | ~4.2 | Gerhardt & Bancalari 1980 |

### CCW/CL Ratio

| Population | CCW/CL Ratio |
|------------|--------------|
| Preterm infants | ~5:1 |
| Term infants | ~3:1 |
| Adults | ~1:1 |

## Summary

This comprehensive review from the Hooper lab (Monash University, Australia) synthesizes current understanding of neonatal chest wall mechanics. Key points:

1. **Cartilaginous composition** of neonatal ribs makes chest wall highly compliant at birth
2. **High CCW is functionally necessary** - allows chest to expand and accommodate:
   - Lung liquid cleared into pulmonary interstitium
   - Incoming air establishing FRC
3. **Trade-off:** High CCW reduces breathing efficiency (chest wall retractions, increased work of breathing)
4. **Maturation:** CCW decreases rapidly in first 2 weeks as ribs ossify; reaches adult-like values (~1:1 CCW/CL) by ~1 year

### Clinical Implications

- Preterm infants most affected (CCW ~5x CL, plus immature lungs)
- External pressures (swaddling, negative pressure) can modulate chest wall mechanics
- Understanding CCW/CL ratio important for ventilation strategies

## Notes

- This is a review, not primary data - cite for synthesized conclusions
- Hooper group is authoritative in neonatal respiratory physiology
- Useful for contextualizing why chest wall mechanics matter for manikin fidelity
- Paper also discusses FRC establishment at birth - potentially relevant for ventilation protocols
